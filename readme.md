# World Happiness Report
For a live Demo: https://paultracey-dashboard.herokuapp.com/

**Design**

The design principle of this dashboard was driven by "Crossfilter.js"'s ability to allow the graphs to interact with one another. As such there's 3 types of graphs;
1. One displaying the number of countries with arbitrarily defined levels of happiness
2. Another displaying the regions (encompassing countries) and their average happiness scores (which are out of ten)
3. Thirdly there are 6 pie charts which describe the attributes of the countries selected

**Interactions**

As stated, the choices of the dashboard have been made to allow for interesting insights, such as;
1. Examining certain regions of the world in terms of happiness, life expectancy, family sizes, etc.
2. Examining the characteristics of happy/sad countries (Observe how important GDP is as opposed to Generosity)
3. Observing how different characteristics affect one another (See how little GDP is related to Governmental Trust)

**Additional Notes**

The data set used was obtained from kaggle and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness

This project was made using HTML5, CSS3, Python, Flask and JavaScript Libraries.
